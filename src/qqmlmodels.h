    \defgroup QT_QML_MODELS Qt models for QML

    Brings a bunch of ready-to-use C++ models for usual use cases in C++/QML apps :
    \li Exposing a list of QObject-derived objects to QML while supporting dynamic changes
    \li Using a simple list of QVariant / QVariantMap just as easy as plain QML ListModel item
    \li etc...
